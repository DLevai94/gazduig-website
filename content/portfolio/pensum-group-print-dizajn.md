We’ve had the pleasure to work together with Digicomstory on several projects in the past and we were super happy when they asked us to create a new brand and web design for their agency.

Our approach was to create a cool design that fits their target audience and communicates how they work and what they are like as a team.

We went our of our way to draw plenty of icons for the content provided to create a fun experience for the viewer. The animations that were added in development completed the experience that we were looking to achieve with the new brand.
